# xe_MRI_projects
## Research projects for the Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI Group, Duke University
### augmented_segmentation:
Analyzing the effects including airways in 129Xe MRI segmentations on bias field correction and voxel intensity distribution rescaling
### hgb_correction:
Establishing a correction for patient hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration in 129Xe gas exchange MRI
### spec_ratios:
Extracting key 129Xe MRI gas exchange metrics from spectroscopy callibration scans. Analyzing and correcting for differences between metrics extracted from spectroscopy and metrics extracted from 3D gas exchange images.
### xe_ref_volt:
Analyzing calibrated xenon MRI reference voltage dependence on patient variables (i.e. weight, proton MRI reference amplitude) in order to predict xenon calibration voltages
