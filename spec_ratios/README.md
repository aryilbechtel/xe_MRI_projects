# spec_ratios
Calibration spectroscopy scans are done prior to 129Xe MRI gas exchange imaging. Key metrics typically extracted from 3D gas exchange images can be also measured with spectroscopy data. This project aims to extract key gas exchange metrics from spectroscopy data as well as compare and improve agreement with metrics extracted from gas exchange data.
