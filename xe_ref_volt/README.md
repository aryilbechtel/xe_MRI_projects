# xe_ref_volt
The reference voltage required to achieve a given flip angle in 129Xe MRI is specific to each patient and the specifics of each scan setup. This voltage is currently calculated form the results of calibration spectroscopy scans prior to gas exchange and ventillation imaging. This project aims to analyze calibrated xenon MRI reference voltage dependence on patient variables (i.e. weight, proton MRI reference amplitude) in order to predict xenon calibration voltages.
