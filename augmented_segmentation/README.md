# augmented_segmentation
Voxel intensity distributions for 129Xe MRI are often normalized to the 99th percentile intensity among bias field corrected voxels in the thoracic cavity. This project aims to understand the effects of including airway voxels on bias field correction and intensity distribution scaling.
